To do/Notater:
- Lagre til fil
- Lese fra fil ved oppstart
- Opp og ned knapp i samme etasje kan ikke ha samme kost (en eller annen fiks for dette).
- Når to heiser (andre enn den man trykker på) får samme kost utfører begge (legge til identifier i kost som avgjør likheter?) (Justere litt på de her)
- Heisen klarer ikke starte mellom 2 etasjer
- Interne ordre skal ikke håndteres av andre heiser (TROR DETTE ER FIKSA - SJEKKE OM DET FUNKER)
- Flytte på Connections funksjonene
- Utside lys skal settes likt på alle heiser (tror dette funker nå)
- The elevator software should not require reinitialization (manual restart) after intermittent network or motor power loss. 
- Start up after program crash?
- Bruke insert spaces(4) i stedet for tab???


Fra specs:

- The elevator software should not require reinitialization (manual restart) after intermittent network or motor power loss.

- The hall "call upward" and "call downward" buttons should behave differently 

- The lights on the hall buttons should show the same thing on all n workspaces

- How the elevator behaves when it cannot connect to the network during initialization

    You can either enter a "single-elevator" mode, or refuse to start (refuse to start?)

- How the hall (call up, call down) buttons work when the elevator is disconnected from the network

    You can optionally refuse to take these new orders (refuse to take new orders?)


-No orders are lost
	Once the light on an hall call button (buttons for calling an elevator to that floor; top 6 buttons on the control panel) is turned on, an elevator should arrive at that floor.

    Similarly for a cab call (for telling the elevator what floor you want to exit at; front 4 buttons on the control panel), but only the elevator at that specific workspace should take the order.

    This means handling network packet loss, losing network connection entirely, losing power - both to the elevator motor and the machine that controls the elevator, and software that crashes.

        For cab orders, handling loss of power/software crash implies that the orders are executed once service is restored
        The time used to detect these failures should be reasonable, ie. on the order of magnitude of seconds (not minutes)
    
    If the elevator is disconnected from the network, it should still serve all the currently active orders (ie. whatever lights are showing)
        It should also keep taking new cab calls, so that people can exit the elevator even if it is disconnected from the network



You can make these assumptions and still get full score:

-At least one elevator is always working normally

-No multiple simultaneous errors: Only one error happens at a time, but the system must still return to a fail-safe state after this error
    Network packet loss is not an error in this context, and must be considered regardless of any other (single) error that can occur.

- No network partitioning: Situations where there are multiple sets of two or more elevators with no connection between them can be ignored
